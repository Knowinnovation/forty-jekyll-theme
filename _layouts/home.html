                <p><p>Over the last year we have had the chance to talk with many interesting, enthusiastic, and ingenious individuals. From the mouths of our interviewees, we have collected habits, environments, tools, and processes that can help other mentors broaden participation in underrepresented minorities in the scientific realm.</p>

<p>Before diving into those collections, we wanted to share with you the stories themselves: who the mentors are, the situations that their students were in, the challenges they faced, and the ways they overcame them. Here you will find narrative accounts of each mentorâ€™s success. We hope that you can read them and find wisdom, humor, and inspiration.</p>
